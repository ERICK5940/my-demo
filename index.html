He had a sister Vidhya, who died when she was two years old. His sister's death affected Vijay greatly; according to his mother, Vijay, who was very talkative, naughty and hyperactive as a child, became silent after Vidhya's death. In her memory, Vijay named his production house, V.V Productions, which stands for Vidhya-Vijay productions This shows how much love he still holds for his departed sibling.
